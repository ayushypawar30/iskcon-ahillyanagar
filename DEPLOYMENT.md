# How to Host Your Website

Since I am an AI assistant running locally on your computer, I cannot directly host the website on the internet for you. However, you can easily do it yourself for **free** in just a few minutes!

Here are the two easiest ways to host your ISKCON Ahillyanagar website:

## Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest & Fastest)
**Best for:** Getting a link instantly without creating an account immediately.

1.  Open your web browser and go to [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2.  Open the folder on your computer where your project is located:
    *   **Path:** `C:\Users\intel\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\iskcon-ahillyanagar`
3.  **Drag and drop** the entire `iskcon-ahillyanagar` folder onto the area that says "Drag and drop your site folder here".
4.  Wait a few seconds. Netlify will upload your files and give you a **live URL** (e.g., `https://random-name-12345.netlify.app`).
5.  You can share this link with anyone!

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Best for Long Term)
**Best for:** Permanent hosting and easy updates.

1.  Create a new repository on [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
2.  Upload all the files from the `iskcon-ahillyanagar` folder to this repository.
3.  Go to the repository **Settings** > **Pages**.
4.  Under "Source", select `main` (or `master`) branch and click **Save**.
5.  GitHub will generate a link like `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`.

## Important Note
Before deploying, make sure all your files (`index.html`, `css/style.css`, `images/`, etc.) are in the correct folder structure, which they currently are.

**Your Project Folder Path:**
`C:\Users\intel\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\iskcon-ahillyanagar`
